## Overview

In this lab, you will model a simple household thermometer using a Swift class. It will contain a few properties that you can use to explore the concept of properties as it applies to Swift classes.

## Directions

The directions for this lab have been written in `Thermometer.playground`, which is distributed with this repository. Open that file to get started. It contains directions on how to complete the lab. The file also includes some tests. When you first open up the playground, these tests will fail, and will be marked as errors. As you complete the tasks in the lab, the errors should disappear. When you have successfully finished the lab, all of the errors will be gone.

Good luck!

> Life is pure adventure, and the sooner we realize that, the quicker we will be able to treat life as art. -[Maya Angelou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou)

## Overview

In this lab, you will create some classes, along with properties and methods for those classes. You will see how these classes can interact with each other to do something useful.

## Directions

This lab has been written in the `Classes.playground` file that accompanies this repository. Open `Classes.playground` to get started. You will see some directions and tasks you need to complete. Areas marked `// write your code here` need to be filled in by you. Tests have been included in the form of `assert()` statements. _Do not change any of the test code!_ When you first open up the playground, it will have a number of errors, but as you work through the lab, the errors should disappear. When there are no more errors, you have successfully completed the lab.

Good luck!
